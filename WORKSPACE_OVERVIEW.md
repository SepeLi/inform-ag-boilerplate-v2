# ðŸ“„ Technical Assessment Deliverables

## 1. Assumptions and Dependencies

- The backend API is RESTful, well-documented, and provides endpoints for authentication, pump listing and inspection data.
- User authentication is via secure tenancy login (JWT).
- The frontend is a React SPA (Next.js app directory) using Bootstrap for UI.
- Multi-tenancy is handled via backend logic and tokens; the frontend passes the correct credentials/token.

## 2. Web Application Architecture & Code Structure

- **Frontend:** React SPA using Nx for modularity and scalability.
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit for global state (auth, pumps, UI state).
- **UI:** Bootstrap 5 for consistent, responsive design.
- **API Layer:** Custom hooks/services for backend communication (REST or TRPC).
- **Validation:** Zod for form and API response validation.

**Code Structure:**

```
apps/
  pump-master/         # Next.js app (React, Bootstrap)
    app/               # App directory (pages, layouts, etc.)
    features/          # Feature-based modules (auth, pumps, navigation)
    store/             # Redux store setup
    public/            # Static assets
libs/
  ui/                  # Shared UI components (Button, Modal, etc.)
  procedures/          # Shared business logic, validation schemas
  server/              # API client, TRPC routers (if needed)
  utils/               # Utility functions (e.g., JWT parsing)
```

- **Feature-based structure**: Each feature (auth, pumps, inspection) is isolated for maintainability.
- **Shared libraries**: UI and business logic are reusable across the workspace.

## 3. Integration with Existing Backend

- **API Client**: Service layer (e.g., `libs/server`) with functions for login, fetching pumps, searching, and inspections.
- **Authentication**: Store JWT/token in HTTP-only cookies or secure storage; attach to API requests.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error boundary and notification system for API errors.
- **Type Safety**: Use OpenAPI/Swagger codegen if available, or Zod schemas for runtime validation.
- **Alternative**: Use fetch or axios in the React app to make HTTP requests to the backend.

## 4. Tooling & Technologies

- **Nx**: Monorepo management, task running, code generation
- **Next.js 15**: Main frontend framework (app directory)
- **React 19**: UI library
- **Typescript**: Type-safe coding
- **TRPC**: Type-safe API between frontend and backend
- **Redux Toolkit**: State management
- **Bootstrap 5**: UI styling
- **Zod**: Schema validation
- **Vite**: Library builds (for libs)
- **Vitest**: Unit testing for libraries
- **Playwright**: E2E testing
- **Storybook**: UI component development/testing
- **Cursor AI**: Accelerate the development process
- **Postman**: API tests

**Rationale:**

- These tools are modern, widely adopted, and support rapid, maintainable development. Nx and modular libraries ensure scalability for future features.

## 5. Testing and Validation

- **Unit Tests**: All business logic, reducers, and utility functions tested with Vitest.
- **Component Tests**: UI components tested in isolation (Vitest/Storybook).
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright scripts for login, pump management, and inspection flows.
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for all forms and API responses.
- **CI Integration**: Nx Cloud or GitHub Actions for automated testing and linting on PRs.

## 6. Project Timeline & Iteration Plan

| Phase               | Tasks                                          | Est. Effort |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1. Setup            | Nx workspace, repo, CI, base app, auth flow    | 2 days      |
| 2. Pump Overview    | List/search/filter pumps, UI, API integration  | 2 days      |
| 3. Pump Management  | CRUD operations, validation, error handling    | 2 days      |
| 4. Pump Inspection  | Inspection UI, data fetch, validation          | 2 days      |
| 5. Testing & Polish | Unit/E2E tests, Storybook, accessibility, docs | 2 days      |
| **Total**           |                                                | **10 days** |

- **Iterations**: Each phase is a deliverable; feedback is incorporated before moving to the next.
